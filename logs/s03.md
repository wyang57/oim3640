<!-- Whatever you learned -->

"integers, which represent numbers with no fractional or decimal part, and
floating-point numbers, which represent integers and numbers with a decimal point."
    
<!-- (I didn't know what floating-point numbers were before the reading) -->

"If you add, subtract, or multiply two integers, the result is an integer. But if you divide two integers, the result is a floating-point number. Python provides another operator, //, that performs integer division. The result of integer division is always an integer."

In some other languages, the caret, ^, is used for exponentiation, but in Python it is a bitwise operator called XOR. If you are not familiar with bitwise operators, the result might be unexpected:

7 ^ 2
5
<!-- (I am not familiar with bitwise operators) -->

So far we’ve seen three kinds of values:
- 2 is an integer,
- 42.0 is a floating-point number, and
- 'Hello' is a string.

<!-- (The terminology does sometimes feel intimidating, if possible I'd hope to find some simulations to get used to these) -->
- arithmetic operator: A symbol, like + and *, that denotes an arithmetic operation like addition or multiplication.
- integer: A type that represents numbers with no fractional or decimal part.
- floating-point: A type that represents integers and numbers with decimal parts.
- integer division: An operator, //, that divides two numbers and rounds down to an integer.
- expression: A combination of variables, values, and operators.
- value: An integer, floating-point number, or string – or one of other kinds of values we will see later.
- function: A named sequence of statements that performs some useful operation. Functions may or may not take arguments and may or may not produce a result.
- function call: An expression – or part of an expression – that runs a function. It consists of the function name followed by an argument list in parentheses.
- syntax error: An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse – and therefore impossible to run.
- string: A type that represents sequences of characters.
- concatenation: Joining two strings end-to-end.
- type: A category of values. The types we have seen so far are integers (type int), floating-point numbers (type float), and strings (type str).
- operand: One of the values on which an operator operates.
- natural language: Any of the languages that people speak that evolved naturally.
- formal language: Any of the languages that people have designed for specific purposes, such as representing mathematical ideas or computer programs. All programming languages are formal languages.
- bug: An error in a program.
- debugging: The process of finding and correcting errors.
- variable: A name that refers to a value.
- assignment statement: A statement that assigns a value to a variable.
- state diagram: A graphical representation of a set of variables and the values they refer to.
- keyword: A special word used to specify the structure of a program.
- import statement: A statement that reads a module file so we can use the variables and functions it contains.
- module: A file that contains Python code, including function definitions and sometimes other statements.
- dot operator: The operator, ., used to access a function in another module by specifying the module name followed by a dot and the function name.
- evaluate: Perform the operations in an expression in order to compute a value.
- statement: One or more lines of code that represent a command or action.
- execute: Run a statement and do what it says.
- argument: A value provided to a function when the function is called.
- comment: Text included in a program that provides information about the program but has no effect on its execution.
- runtime error: An error that causes a program to display an error message and exit.
- exception: An error that is detected while the program is running.
- semantic error: An error that causes a program to do the wrong thing, but not to display an error message.
