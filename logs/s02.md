What a terminal is...

After reading the "Why Python keeps growing, explained" article, I learned that big companies like "NASA uses Python to power data analysis with its sophisticated James Webb Space Telescope." Which is one of the main reasons why Python keeps growing. The second most significant in my opinion according to the source of the article is that it's taught at a young age, "Python has become the go-to language in academia with some students even encountering Python as early as elementary school."

According to the youtube video on "How GitHub works." GitHub provides a platform where several people anywhere in the world can build software together as one project. It basically provided an example using harvesting (Eddie who harvests using a tractor) to show how you're able to share changes through push and pull requests and get feedback from it.
