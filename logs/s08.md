From drones to code
- Breaking each big problem into smaller pieces, each portion of code can work on its own

Decomposition: Break big problems into smaller, manageable pieces
Abstraction: Hide the details, focus on inputs and outputs

Function structure
- Name → how we call it
- Parameters → inputs it can take
- Docstring (optional but strongly recommended) → explanation of what it does
- Body → the code it runs
- Return value → the result it gives back
